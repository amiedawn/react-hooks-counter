# React Counter App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose 

The purpose of this app is very simple: make a basic counter, using a functional component and React hooks. Every odd number shows a gray number and every even number is black. This app also uses Sass for styling.
